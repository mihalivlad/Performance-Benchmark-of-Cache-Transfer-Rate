# Performance-Benchmark-of-Cache-Transfer-Rate
The goal of this project is to design and implement a benchmark for cache memory that

evaluate the performance of transferring data in cache memory, intern memory and virtual

memory. We test pure cache memory (without memory management).


The outcome of the program will be general information about memory size, charts that

represents comparison of different memory transfer rate and tables with different miss and

hit information.
